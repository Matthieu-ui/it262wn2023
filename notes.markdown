1. List and discuss the different types of Heuristics.  Why do people use heuristics?

we all use heuristics to make everyday decisions, they are a mental shortcut that allows us to make decisions quickly and efficiently based off of past experiences or what we know. 

There are 2 types of heuristics: availability heuristic and representativeness heuristic.

* Availability heuristic: we make decisions based off of what we can remember. For example, if you are trying to decide what to eat for dinner, you will probably choose something that you have eaten recently because it is easier to remember and you know you like it.

* Representativeness heuristic: we make decisions based off of how similar something is to a prototype. For example, if you are trying to decide what to eat for dinner, you will probably choose something that is similar to something you have eaten before because you know you like it.


3. Define attribution theory. Who talked about this phenomena? How does culture
     influence people’s interpretation of causal attributions?

     I would define attribution theory as the way people explain the causes of their own and other people's behavior. Fritz Heider talked about this phenomena. Culture influences people's interpretation of causal attributions because people from different cultures have different beliefs about the causes of behavior. For example, in the United States, people tend to attribute behavior to internal causes, such as personality traits, while in other cultures, people tend to attribute behavior to external causes, such as the environment.

4. What is the significance of social cognitive theory? Discuss some of its basic assumptions?  What is Bandura's connection with this theory?
   
   Social cognitive theory is significant because it explains how people learn by observing others. Such as how children learn by watching their parents. Bandura's connection with this was through his research on observational learning and social learning theory which is a part of social cognitive theory, he was the first to study observational learning in children.


5.  Define social cognition. Describe the 4 processes involved in social cognition.

Social cognition is the way people think about themselves and others. The 4 processes involved in social cognition are:

* Categorization: Grouping people into categories based on their similarities.

* Stereotyping: Making assumptions about a person based on their membership in a group.

* Prejudice: A negative attitude towards a person based on their status in a group.

* Discrimination: Treating a person differently based on the group they belong to.

* Define Attribution error. How do  "self serving bias" and "actor observer bias"  relate to attribution error?

Attribution error is when we make causal attributions that are not accurate.

 Self serving bias is when we take credit for our successes and blame our failures on external factors and actor observer bias is when we attribute our own behavior to internal factors and other people's behavior to external factors.

 Self serving bias and actor observer bias are both attribution errors because they are not accurate.

  <!-- Chapter 1 Professionalism

The author using the abbreviation QA, (Quality Assurance) Links to an external site.as if it’s a group, and also as if it’s a process. Think of QA as a third party, whose job it is to find defects in our code, or subjects our code to tests we may not have even imagined.


1) According to the author, what is professionalism all about? 

Professionalism is a badge of responsibility and accountability. It is about being a professional and doing your job well and doing your part.


2) The author explains “The first thing you need to do is practice apologizing”.  Why is this?  How would a person in his position limit the need for apologies? 

Apologizing is important because it shows that you are human and that you make mistakes. It also shows that you are willing to admit your mistakes and learn from them. People are never perfect and make mistakes but as a professional you really should make limited mistakes.

3) What percentage of code does the author recommend be able to be tested?  Is this realistic?  Why? 

The author suggests that 100% of code be able to be tested. This is realistic because it is possible to test all code. It is just a matter of how much time you are willing to put into it.

4) How do you write code that is easy to test?

You write code that is easy to test by writing code that is easy to read and understand. You also write code that is easy to test by writing code that has a clear purpose.

5) What does the author mean by “merciless refactoring?” 

Merciless refactoring is when you go back and change your code to make it better. You do this by making your code more efficient and easier to read and understand and being merciless about it means do it all the time. 



6) What is the benefit of having code that has great coverage and is easy to test?

The benefit of having code that has great coverage and is easy to test is that it is easier to find bugs and fix them.

7) The author identifies he believes you should consider programming a 60 hour a week job, with 20 hours a week devoted to caring for your profession.  However he claims this prevents burnout?  How could this be so?

The author believes that you should consider programming a 60 hour a week job, with 20 hours a week devoted to caring for your profession. This prevents burnout because it gives you time to relax and do other things. It also gives you time to learn new things and practice your skills.



8) Why does the author advocate learning new languages?

The author advocates learning new languages because it is important to keep up with the times and learn new things. The industry is always changing and you need to keep up with it.



9) The author identifies practice as being the key way to maintain programming professionalism, however he indicates this needs to be done outside your daily job.  Why is this? 

The author identifies practice as being the key way to maintain programming professionalism and that is what will set you apart from others. You need to practice outside of your daily job because you need to practice to get better and you need to practice to learn new things. You can't learn new things if you don't practice.


1)  What does the author claim as the best way to learn? Have you found this to be true?  How so?

The author claims that the best way to learn is to practice, collaborate, and teach. I have found this to be true because I have learned the most when I have practiced and collaborated with others. Teaching is great because you really need to know something well in order to teach it.

<!-- To determine if lack of exercise reduces flexibility in the knee joint, physical therapists ask for volunteers to join their trials. The volunteers then choose to be in the group that exercises or to be in the group that doesn't exercise. Is this a randomized experiment? -->

<!-- I would say that this is not a randomized experiment because the volunteers are choosing to be in the group that exercises or not. They are not being randomly assigned to the group that exercises or not. -->

<!-- linkedIn post about code path acceptance

I am excited to have been excepted into the code path intermediate web development course! I am looking forward to learning new things and improving my skills. I am also looking forward to collaborating with others and learning from them. Really looking forward to be a part of this program and to what the future holds. #NeverStopLearning -->

<!-- code review -->
<!-- What's wrong with being right?
1. being right is not always the best thing. sometimes you need to be wrong in order to learn and grow.

Why should a code reviewer avoid generalized feedback?
2. a code reviewer should avoid generalized feedback because it is not really helpful... it is better to be specific and give examples, help the person understand what they did wrong and how to fix it so they can learn.


What's the danger of labeling?
3. labeling can be hurtful and it can make people feel bad. it can also make people feel like they are not part of the team.

What should we do if stress is identified?
4. Try to help the person and try to figure out what is causing the stress and if you can help out or be supportive if anything.

Which form of code review would you prefer? Why?
5. I think I would prefer just a formal code review because it is more professional and it is more structured. I think it would be easier to get things done and to get feedback.


Do you believe the potential gains in performing effective code reviews outweigh the possible issues?  Explain.
6. Yeah I think there is a lot to gain in effective code review, because if it is effective it should help you learn and grow and improve


If you have any experience with code review, please share! 
7. I have had a little experience with code review but it has mostly been practice and educational purposes. I know I will learn alot from code reviews.  --> --> -->

<!-- 
1) In the author's view, what is the result of responding with "I'll try" when being asked to do something programmatically in an unrealistic time frame? -->

A response like "I'll try" is just unprofessional and it is not a good way to respond to someone. It is better to be honest and say that you can't do it in that time frame.


2) At one point the author states, "hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of adversarial roles".  What does he mean?

The author means people have a job to do and decisions need to be made. Sometimes for things to work you have to be willing to make the hard decisions and stand up for what you believe in, that might work in your favor and it might not.

1) When explaining details to non-developers, why is "why" not as important?  What could be the outcome of explaining why you are not able to do something programmatically to a layman who wishes you to complete a task?

Explaining why is not as important to non-developers because they don't need to know why or how something works. They just need to know what you are doing and how you are doing it. It might cause confusion if you went into depth. You should just get straight to the point.

1) The author states, "The most important time to say no is when the stakes are the highest".  Is this surprising?  What could the cumulative effect of saying "no" too many times be to your career?

The higher the stakes the more valuable "no" is. If you say no too many times it is sort of like crying wolf and people will stop listening to you. You need to be careful when you say no and when you say yes. Your career could suffer if you say no too many times, you'll get "YES, or else".


1) In the author's view, is a team player someone who says yes all the time?  How do you feel about this?

I agree to an extent, I think being on a team means you have a responsibility and you signed up for it so you need to be accountable. Although I think in some cases you could be taken advantage of you should be aware of that. 


2) The author states, "Sometimes the only way to get to the right yes is to be unafraid to say no." Why is this?  Do you agree?

Yeah, I agree you need to know how to bargain and negotiate and sometimes you need to say no to get to the right yes. You need to be able to stand up for yourself but also be willing to compromise.


 1) The author relays a story by another developer about a rush job on an IPhone App for "Gorilla Mart". Why does the client frequently think "the app is simple"? 

The client thinks the app is simple because they don't know how to code. They don't know how long it takes to do something and they don't know how much work it takes to do something. They just think it is simple because it sounds simple.



1) During the "Gorilla Mart" story, the developer John states, "The demands of the client prevent me from writing good code."  What does he mean?

They created a rush job and they didn't have time to write good code. They had to get it done and they had to get it done fast. How could they even test properly.


1) After relaying the "Gorilla Mart" story, the author places the blame for the situation entirely on the developer, "John".  Do you agree?  What could John have done differently?

I think john could have negotiated and communicated more effectively. I think he needed to learned better from past experience and put that into practice. He should have been more aware of the situation and he should have been more aware of the client.

2)  How is being a hero different than being a professional?

Hero's save the day. A professional is someone who is good at what they do and they are accountable and they are responsible. They should not have to be a hero to get the job done. They should be able to do their job and do it well.
